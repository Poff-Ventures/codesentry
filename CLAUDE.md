## Code Analysis Engine Logic
The mock AI analysis engine uses rule-based detection:
- **Complexity Scoring**: Counts loops, conditions, functions
- **Issue Detection**: Language-specific patterns (var usage, console.log, etc.)
- **Quality Scoring**: 85 base score minus penalties for issues and complexity
- **Recommendations**: Contextual suggestions based on detected issues
- **Visual Feedback**: Circular progress indicators, color-coded severity levels

## Revenue Model Details
- **Free Tier**: 50 reviews/month, basic analysis, email support
- **Pro Tier**: $25/user/month, unlimited reviews, GitHub integration, team features
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, on-premise deployment, dedicated support
- **Trial**: 14-day free trial for Pro tier, no credit card required
